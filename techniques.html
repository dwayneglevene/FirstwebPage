        <h3>Sampling</h3>
        <p>In music, sampling is the reuse of a portion (or sample) of a sound recording in another recording. Samples may comprise rhythm, melody, speech, sounds, or entire bars of music, and may be layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. They are usually integrated using hardware (samplers) or software such as digital audio workstations. </p>

        <h3>Original production</h3>
        <p>Music, in general, is the balance of two concepts: variation and repetition.

Without any variation, the listener can get bored (and will likely skip to the next song). Without any repetition, the listener does not really have anything to latch onto, which can cause the music to feel unstructured.

Its the composers job to find the right compromise between variation and repetition to create something that is interesting but still relatively accessible to a non-musical listener. In the world of beat-making, where repetition is so prevalent that it can become overwhelming, finding this compromise is especially important.</p>
